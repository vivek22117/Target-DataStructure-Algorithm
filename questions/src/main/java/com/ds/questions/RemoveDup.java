/**
 * Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
 * <p>
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
 * <p>
 * Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
 * <p>
 * It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],
 * <p>
 * Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
 * <p>
 * It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
