/**
 * Given an array of integers, return a new array such that 
 * each element at index i of the new array is the product 
 * of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

   For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
   the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. 
   If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

   Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
