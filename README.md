# Target-DataStructure-Algorithm

We will create package in the name of collaborators, under which anyone can as a question by creating a empty class. We should have a comment section on that empty class where we describe the problem statement with dummy samples.

At the same time we will tag the collaborators to solve the problem. We can discuss the solutions on call or Zoom meetings or Skype meetings about the solutions in a way of Interview.
